## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes bundled with Node.js)

## Installation Instructions

Step-by-step guide on how to install and set up the Golden Wheat project on a local machine.

### Installation Instructions (Backend)

1. Clone the repository: Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/chai-py/GreenFit_Fitness_Backend

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd GreenFit_Fitness_Backend

3. Install dependencies: npm install

4. Install additional dependencies: npm install express mongoose dotenv

5. Set up MongoDB connection: Copy your Mongo URI and add it to your .env file in the project root. Your .env file should look like this: MONGO_URI=your-mongo-uri-here

6. Start the backend server: node index.js

7. Verify the API: Open your browser and navigate to the API endpoint: http://localhost:4000

8. Use the API on the Frontend: Once the backend server is running, the frontend can now make API calls to these endpoints:

- http://localhost:4000/training

Add these endpoints to the frontend environment to fetch and display data as needed.

### Additional Notes:

- Ensure that MongoDB is running and properly connected to the backend.
- If any errors occur while running the server, double-check the dependencies and the Mongo URI in your .env file.
- Deployment using Vercel
